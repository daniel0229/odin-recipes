    <p>
        This Swedish meatball recipe is our family's Christmas tradition.<br />
         We frequently double the recipe and keep it warm in a slow cooker.<br />
          Worth the effort, and the meatballs are even better the next day!<br />
           Reserve brown gravy and add sour cream to it the day you serve the leftovers.
